# What's Your Name

What's Your Name (WhatsYourName.me) is a Google Glass app that recognizes whoever you are looking at. All the user has to do is touch the side of Glass or say "What's your name," at which point our app returns back whoever the user is looking at.

Our app integrates with the user's Facebook account and then uses computer vision to return back the name of the person who the user is looking at.

This has profound implications for not only the everyday person but also for Alzheimer's patients. There is no way when anyone will have the awkward encounter of forgetting the name of a new friend.
